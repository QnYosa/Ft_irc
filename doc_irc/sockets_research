Le principe : 
"One socket (node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. 
The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server."
"A socket connection means the two machines have information about each other, including network location (IP address) and TCP port. "


Cheat sheet :
Socket: Create a new communication
Bind: Attach a local address to a socket
Listen: Announce willingness to accept connections
Accept: Block caller until a connection request arrives
Connect: Actively attempt to establish a connection
Send: Send some data over a connection
Receive: Receive some data over a connection
Close: Release the connection

Autre façon de résumer le process :
Server Socket
1. create a socket - Get the file descriptor!
2. bind to an address -What port am I on?
3. listen on a port, and wait for a connection to be established.
4. accept the connection from a client.
5. send/recv - the same way we read and write for a file.
6. shutdown to end read/write.
7. close to releases data.

Client Socket
1. create a socket.
2. bind* - this is probably be unnecessary because you're the client, not the server.
3. connect to a server.
4. send/recv - repeat until we have or receive data
5. shutdown to end read/write.
6. close to releases data.
